Through them and\nbetween them the sun shone bravely; and a copse which had worn its firs\nall the year round seemed old and dowdy now beside the new green lace\nwhich the beeches had put on so prettily. Through copse and spinney\nmarched Bear; down open slopes of gorse and heather, over rocky beds of\nstreams, up steep banks of sandstone into the heather again; and so at\nlast, tired and hungry, to the Hundred Acre Wood. For it was in the\nHundred Acre Wood that Owl lived.\nWhen I first heard his name, I said, just as you are going to say, \"But\nI thought he was a boy?\"\n\n\"So did I,\" said Christopher Robin.\n\n\"Then you can't call him Winnie?\"\n\n\"I don't.\"\n\n\"But you said----\"\n\n\"He's Winnie-ther-Pooh.

So off they\nwent together.\n\nThere was a small spinney of larch trees just here, and it seemed as if\nthe two Woozles, if that is what they were, had been going round this\nspinney; so round this spinney went Pooh and Piglet after them; Piglet\npassing the time by telling Pooh what his Grandfather Trespassers W had\ndone to Remove Stiffness after Tracking, and how his Grandfather\nTrespassers W had suffered in his later years from Shortness of Breath,\nand other matters of interest, and Pooh wondering what a Grandfather was\nlike, and if perhaps this was Two Grandfathers they were after now, and,\nif so, whether he would be allowed to take one home and keep it, and\nwhat Christopher Robin would say.

You\nnever can tell with paw-marks.\"\n\nWith these few words he went on tracking, and Piglet, after watching him\nfor a minute or two, ran after him.

So he decided to do something helpful instead.\n\n\"Eeyore,\" he said solemnly, \"I, Winnie-the-Pooh, will find your tail for\nyou.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Pooh,\" answered Eeyore. \"You're a real friend,\" said he.\n\"Not like Some,\" he said.\n\nSo Winnie-the-Pooh went off to find Eeyore's tail.\n\"Eeyore,\" he said solemnly, \"I, Winnie-the-Pooh, will find your tail for\nyou.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Pooh,\" answered Eeyore. \"You're a real friend,\" said he.\n\"Not like Some,\" he said.\n\nSo Winnie-the-Pooh went off to find Eeyore's tail.\n\nIt was a fine spring morning in the forest as he started out. Little\nsoft clouds played happily in a blue sky, skipping from time to time in\nfront of the sun as if they had come to put it out, and then sliding\naway suddenly so that the next might have his turn. Through them and\nbetween them the sun shone bravely; and a copse which had worn its firs\nall the year round seemed old and dowdy now beside the new green lace\nwhich the beeches had put on so prettily.

You\nhad had a big green balloon; and one of Rabbit's relations had had a big\nblue one, and had left it behind, being really too young to go to a\nparty at all; and so you had brought the green one _and_ the blue one\nhome with you.\n\n\"Which one would you like?\" you asked Pooh.\n\nHe put his head between his paws and thought very carefully.\n\"Very well,\" said Pooh, and he stumped off.\n\nAs soon as he got home, he went to the larder; and he stood on a chair,\nand took down a very large jar of honey from the top shelf. It had HUNNY\nwritten on it, but, just to make sure, he took off the paper cover and\nlooked at it, and it _looked_ just like honey. \"But you never can tell,\"\nsaid Pooh. \"I remember my uncle saying once that he had seen cheese just\nthis colour.\" So he put his tongue in, and took a large lick. \"Yes,\" he\nsaid, \"it is. No doubt about that. And honey, I should say, right down\nto the bottom of the jar. Unless, of course,\" he said, \"somebody put\ncheese in at the bottom just for a joke. Perhaps I had better go a\n_little_ further ... just in case ... in case Heffalumps _don't_\nlike cheese ... same as me.... Ah!\" And he gave a deep sigh. \"I\n_was_ right. It _is_ honey, right the way down.\"\n\"This is Serious,\" said Pooh. \"I must have an Escape.\"\n\nSo he took his largest pot of honey and escaped with it to a broad\nbranch of his tree, well above the water, and then he climbed down again\nand escaped with another pot ... and when the whole Escape was\nfinished, there was Pooh sitting on his branch, dangling his legs, and\nthere, beside him, were ten pots of honey....\n\nTwo days later, there was Pooh, sitting on his branch, dangling his\nlegs, and there, beside him, were four pots of honey....\n\nThree days later, there was Pooh, sitting on his branch, dangling his\nlegs, and there beside him, was one pot of honey.\n\nFour days later, there was Pooh ...\n\nAnd it was on the morning of the fourth day that Piglet's bottle came\nfloating past him, and with one loud cry of \"Honey!\" Pooh plunged into\nthe water, seized the bottle, and struggled back to his tree again.\n\n\"Bother!\" said Pooh, as he opened it. \"All that wet for nothing. What's\nthat bit of paper doing?\"\n\"But Pooh,\" said Piglet, \"it's your own house!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Pooh. \"So it is,\" he said. \"Well, let's go in.\"\n\nSo in they went. The first thing Pooh did was to go to the cupboard to\nsee if he had quite a small jar of honey left; and he had, so he took it\ndown.\n\n\"I'm giving this to Eeyore,\" he explained, \"as a present. What are _you_\ngoing to give?\"\n\n\"Couldn't I give it too?\" said Piglet. \"From both of us?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Pooh. \"That would _not_ be a good plan.\"\n\n\"All right, then, I'll give him a balloon. I've got one left from my\nparty. I'll go and get it now, shall I?\"\n\n\"That, Piglet, is a _very_ good idea. It is just what Eeyore wants to\ncheer him up. Nobody can be uncheered with a balloon.\"\n\nSo off Piglet trotted; and in the other direction went Pooh, with his\njar of honey.\nWhen Eeyore saw the pot, he became quite excited.\n\n\"Why!\" he said. \"I believe my Balloon will just go into that Pot!\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Eeyore,\" said Pooh. \"Balloons are much too big to go into Pots.\nWhat you do with a balloon is, you hold the ballon----\"\n\n\"Not mine,\" said Eeyore proudly. \"Look, Piglet!\" And as Piglet looked\nsorrowfully round, Eeyore picked the balloon up with his teeth, and\nplaced it carefully in the pot; picked it out and put it on the ground;\nand then picked it up again and put it carefully back.\n\n\"So it does!\" said Pooh. \"It goes in!\"\n\n\"So it does!\" said Piglet. \"And it comes out!\"\n\n\"Doesn't it?\" said Eeyore. \"It goes in and out like anything.\"\n\n\"I'm very glad,\" said Pooh happily, \"that I thought of giving you a\nUseful Pot to put things in.\"\n\n\"I'm very glad,\" said Piglet happily, \"that I thought of giving you\nSomething to put in a Useful Pot.\"\n\nBut Eeyore wasn't listening. He was taking the balloon out, and putting\nit back again, as happy as could be....\n\"Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear!\" said Piglet to himself. And he wanted to\nrun away. But somehow, having got so near, he felt that he must just see\nwhat a Heffalump was like. So he crept to the side of the Trap and\nlooked in....\n\nAnd all the time Winnie-the-Pooh had been trying to get the honey-jar\noff his head. The more he shook it, the more tightly it stuck.\n\n\"_Bother!_\" he said, inside the jar, and \"_Oh, help!_\" and, mostly,\n\"_Ow!_\" And he tried bumping it against things, but as he couldn't see\nwhat he was bumping it against, it didn't help him; and he tried to\nclimb out of the Trap, but as he could see nothing but jar, and not much\nof that, he couldn't find his way. So at last he lifted up his head, jar\nand all, and made a loud, roaring noise of Sadness and Despair ... and\nit was at that moment that Piglet looked down.\n\"Oh!\" said Pooh. And then seeing that Owl expected him to say something\nelse, he said \"Will there be those little cake things with pink sugar\nicing?\"\n\nOwl felt that it was rather beneath him to talk about little cake things\nwith pink sugar icing, so he told Pooh exactly what Christopher Robin\nhad said, and flew off to Eeyore.\n\n\"A party for Me?\" thought Pooh to himself. \"How grand!\" And he began to\nwonder if all the other animals would know that it was a special Pooh\nParty, and if Christopher Robin had told them about _The Floating Bear_\nand the _Brain of Pooh_ and all the wonderful ships he had invented and\nsailed on, and he began to think how awful it would be if everybody had\nforgotten about it, and nobody quite knew what the party was for; and\nthe more he thought like this, the more the party got muddled in his\nmind, like a dream when nothing goes right. And the dream began to sing\nitself over in his head until it became a sort of song. It was an\n\"No,\" said Pooh. \"That would _not_ be a good plan.\"\n\n\"All right, then, I'll give him a balloon. I've got one left from my\nparty. I'll go and get it now, shall I?\"\n\n\"That, Piglet, is a _very_ good idea. It is just what Eeyore wants to\ncheer him up. Nobody can be uncheered with a balloon.\"\n\nSo off Piglet trotted; and in the other direction went Pooh, with his\njar of honey.\n\nIt was a warm day, and he had a long way to go. He hadn't gone more than\nhalf-way when a sort of funny feeling began to creep all over him. It\nbegan at the tip of his nose and trickled all through him and out at the\nsoles of his feet. It was just as if somebody inside him were saying,\n\"Now then, Pooh, time for a little something.\"\nFour days later, there was Pooh ...\n\nAnd it was on the morning of the fourth day that Piglet's bottle came\nfloating past him, and with one loud cry of \"Honey!\" Pooh plunged into\nthe water, seized the bottle, and struggled back to his tree again.\n\n\"Bother!\" said Pooh, as he opened it. \"All that wet for nothing. What's\nthat bit of paper doing?\"\n\nHe took it out and looked at it.\n\n\"It's a Missage,\" he said to himself, \"that's what it is. And that\nletter is a 'P,' and so is that, and so is that, and 'P' means 'Pooh,'\nso it's a very important Missage to me, and I can't read it. I must find\nChristopher Robin or Owl or Piglet, one of those Clever Readers who can\nread things, and they will tell me what this missage means. Only I can't\nswim. Bother!\"\n\nThen he had an idea, and I think that for a Bear of Very Little Brain,\nit was a good idea. He said to himself:\n\n\"If a bottle can float, then a jar can float, and if a jar floats, I can\nsit on the top of it, if it's a very big jar.\"\n\"You mean, in case it really is two Woozles,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh, and\nPiglet said that anyhow he had nothing to do until Friday. So off they\nwent together.\n\nThere was a small spinney of larch trees just here, and it seemed as if\nthe two Woozles, if that is what they were, had been going round this\nspinney; so round this spinney went Pooh and Piglet after them; Piglet\npassing the time by telling Pooh what his Grandfather Trespassers W had\ndone to Remove Stiffness after Tracking, and how his Grandfather\nTrespassers W had suffered in his later years from Shortness of Breath,\nand other matters of interest, and Pooh wondering what a Grandfather was\nlike, and if perhaps this was Two Grandfathers they were after now, and,\nif so, whether he would be allowed to take one home and keep it, and\nwhat Christopher Robin would say.

At first as they stumped along the path\nwhich edged the Hundred Acre Wood, they didn't say much to each other;\nbut when they came to the stream and had helped each other across the\nstepping stones, and were able to walk side by side again over the\nheather, they began to talk in a friendly way about this and that, and\nPiglet said, \"If you see what I mean, Pooh,\" and Pooh said, \"It's just\nwhat I think myself, Piglet,\" and Piglet said, \"But, on the other hand,\nPooh, we must remember,\" and Pooh said, \"Quite true, Piglet, although I\nhad forgotten it for the moment.\" And then, just as they came to the Six\nPine Trees, Pooh looked round to see that nobody else was listening, and\nsaid in a very solemn voice:\n\n\"Piglet, I have decided something.\"\nHaving made certain of this, he took the jar back to Piglet, and Piglet\nlooked up from the bottom of his Very Deep Pit, and said, \"Got it?\" and\nPooh said, \"Yes, but it isn't quite a full jar,\" and he threw it down to\nPiglet, and Piglet said, \"No, it isn't! Is that all you've got left?\"\nand Pooh said \"Yes.\" Because it was. So Piglet put the jar at the bottom\nof the Pit, and climbed out, and they went off home together.\n\n\"Well, good night, Pooh,\" said Piglet, when they had got to Pooh's\nhouse. \"And we meet at six o'clock to-morrow morning by the Pine Trees,\nand see how many Heffalumps we've got in our Trap.\"\n\n\"Six o'clock, Piglet. And have you got any string?\"\n\n\"No. Why do you want string?\"\n\n\"To lead them home with.\"\n\n\"Oh! ... I _think_ Heffalumps come if you whistle.\"\n\n\"Some do and some don't. You never can tell with Heffalumps. Well, good\nnight!\"\n\n\"Good night!\"\n\nAnd off Piglet trotted to his house TRESPASSERS W, while Pooh made his\npreparations for bed.\n\"Oh!\" said Pooh. And then seeing that Owl expected him to say something\nelse, he said \"Will there be those little cake things with pink sugar\nicing?\"\n\nOwl felt that it was rather beneath him to talk about little cake things\nwith pink sugar icing, so he told Pooh exactly what Christopher Robin\nhad said, and flew off to Eeyore.\n\n\"A party for Me?\" thought Pooh to himself. \"How grand!\" And he began to\nwonder if all the other animals would know that it was a special Pooh\nParty, and if Christopher Robin had told them about _The Floating Bear_\nand the _Brain of Pooh_ and all the wonderful ships he had invented and\nsailed on, and he began to think how awful it would be if everybody had\nforgotten about it, and nobody quite knew what the party was for; and\nthe more he thought like this, the more the party got muddled in his\nmind, like a dream when nothing goes right. And the dream began to sing\nitself over in his head until it became a sort of song. It was an\n\"Must you?\" said Rabbit politely.\n\n\"Well,\" said Pooh, \"I could stay a little longer if it--if you----\" and\nhe tried very hard to look in the direction of the larder.\n\n\"As a matter of fact,\" said Rabbit, \"I was going out myself directly.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, then, I'll be going on. Good-bye.\"\n\n\"Well, good-bye, if you're sure you won't have any more.\"\n\n\"_Is_ there any more?\" asked Pooh quickly.\n\nRabbit took the covers off the dishes, and said, \"No, there wasn't.\"\n\n\"I thought not,\" said Pooh, nodding to himself. \"Well, good-bye. I must\nbe going on.\"\n\nSo he started to climb out of the hole. He pulled with his front paws,\nand pushed with his back paws, and in a little while his nose was out in\nthe open again ... and then his ears ... and then his front paws ...\nand then his shoulders ... and then----\n\n\"Oh, help!\" said Pooh. \"I'd better go back.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother!\" said Pooh. \"I shall have to go on.\"\n\n\"I can't do either!\" said Pooh. \"Oh, help _and_ bother!\"\n\"But Pooh,\" said Piglet, \"it's your own house!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Pooh. \"So it is,\" he said. \"Well, let's go in.\"\n\nSo in they went. The first thing Pooh did was to go to the cupboard to\nsee if he had quite a small jar of honey left; and he had, so he took it\ndown.\n\n\"I'm giving this to Eeyore,\" he explained, \"as a present. What are _you_\ngoing to give?\"\n\n\"Couldn't I give it too?\" said Piglet. \"From both of us?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Pooh. \"That would _not_ be a good plan.\"\n\n\"All right, then, I'll give him a balloon. I've got one left from my\nparty. I'll go and get it now, shall I?\"\n\n\"That, Piglet, is a _very_ good idea. It is just what Eeyore wants to\ncheer him up. Nobody can be uncheered with a balloon.\"\n\nSo off Piglet trotted; and in the other direction went Pooh, with his\njar of honey.\n\"Thank you, Pooh. If you've quite finished with it.\" He moved across to\nPooh's place, and began to eat.\n\n\"It don't do them any Good, you know, sitting on them,\" he went on, as\nhe looked up munching. \"Takes all the Life out of them. Remember that\nanother time, all of you. A little Consideration, a little Thought for\nOthers, makes all the difference.\"\n\nAs soon as he had finished his lunch Christopher Robin whispered to\nRabbit, and Rabbit said \"Yes, yes, of course,\" and they walked a little\nway up the stream together.\n\n\"I didn't want the others to hear,\" said Christopher Robin.\n\n\"Quite so,\" said Rabbit, looking important.\n\n\"It's--I wondered--It's only--Rabbit, I suppose _you_ don't know, What\ndoes the North Pole _look_ like?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Rabbit, stroking his whiskers. \"Now you're asking me.\"\n\n\"I did know once, only I've sort of forgotten,\" said Christopher Robin\ncarelessly.\n\n\"It's a funny thing,\" said Rabbit, \"but I've sort of forgotten too,\nalthough I did know _once_.\"\n\"Pooh,\" said Piglet, feeling quite happy again now, \"I will.\" And then\nhe said, \"How shall we do it?\" and Pooh said, \"That's just it. How?\" And\nthen they sat down together to think it out.\n\nPooh's first idea was that they should dig a Very Deep Pit, and then the\nHeffalump would come along and fall into the Pit, and----\n\n\"Why?\" said Piglet.\n\n\"Why what?\" said Pooh.\n\n\"Why would he fall in?\"\n\nPooh rubbed his nose with his paw, and said that the Heffalump might be\nwalking along, humming a little song, and looking up at the sky,\nwondering if it would rain, and so he wouldn't see the Very Deep Pit\nuntil he was half-way down, when it would be too late.\n\nPiglet said that this was a very good Trap, but supposing it were\nraining already?\n\nQuestion: How did they get Pooh out of Rabbit's door?\nAnswer:",

Well, now, if you walk up and down with your umbrella, saying,\n'Tut-tut, it looks like rain,' I shall do what I can by singing a little\nCloud Song, such as a cloud might sing....

Look at their tracks! Three, as it were, Woozles,\nand one, as it was, Wizzle. _Another Woozle has joined them!_\"\n\nAnd so it seemed to be. There were the tracks; crossing over each other\nhere, getting muddled up with each other there; but, quite plainly every\nnow and then, the tracks of four sets of paws.\n\n\"I _think_,\" said Piglet, when he had licked the tip of his nose too,\nand found that it brought very little comfort, \"I _think_ that I have\njust remembered something. I have just remembered something that I\nforgot to do yesterday and shan't be able to do to-morrow. So I suppose\nI really ought to go back and do it now.\"\n\n\"We'll do it this afternoon, and I'll come with you,\" said Pooh.\n\n\"It isn't the sort of thing you can do in the afternoon,\" said Piglet\nquickly. \"It's a very particular morning thing, that has to be done in\nthe morning, and, if possible, between the hours of----What would you\nsay the time was?\"\n\"Hallo, Pooh,\" he said. \"How's things?\"\n\n\"Terrible and Sad,\" said Pooh, \"because Eeyore, who is a friend of mine,\nhas lost his tail.

So could you very kindly\ntell me how to find it for him?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Owl, \"the customary procedure in such cases is as follows.\"\n\n\"What does Crustimoney Proseedcake mean?\" said Pooh. \"For I am a Bear of\nVery Little Brain, and long words Bother me.\"\n\n\"It means the Thing to Do.\"\n\n\"As long as it means that, I don't mind,\" said Pooh humbly.\n\n\"The thing to do is as follows. First, Issue a Reward. Then----\"\n\n\"Just a moment,\" said Pooh, holding up his paw. \"_What_ do we do to\nthis--what you were saying? You sneezed just as you were going to tell\nme.\"\n\n\"I _didn't_ sneeze.\"\n\n\"Yes, you did, Owl.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, Pooh, I didn't. You can't sneeze without knowing it.\"\n\n\"Well, you can't know it without something having been sneezed.\"\n\n\"What I _said_ was, 'First _Issue_ a Reward'.\"\n\n\"You're doing it again,\" said Pooh sadly.\nPooh went into a corner and tried saying 'Aha!' in that sort of voice.\nSometimes it seemed to him that it did mean what Rabbit said, and\nsometimes it seemed to him that it didn't. \"I suppose it's just\npractice,\" he thought. \"I wonder if Kanga will have to practise too so\nas to understand it.\"\n\n\"There's just one thing,\" said Piglet, fidgeting a bit. \"I was talking\nto Christopher Robin, and he said that a Kanga was Generally Regarded as\nOne of the Fiercer Animals. I am not frightened of Fierce Animals in the\nordinary way, but it is well known that, if One of the Fiercer Animals\nis Deprived of Its Young, it becomes as fierce as Two of the Fiercer\nAnimals. In which case '_Aha!_' is perhaps a _foolish_ thing to say.\"\n\n\"Piglet,\" said Rabbit, taking out a pencil, and licking the end of it,\n\"you haven't any pluck.\"\n\n\"It is hard to be brave,\" said Piglet, sniffing slightly, \"when you're\nonly a Very Small Animal.\"\n\nRabbit, who had begun to write very busily, looked up and said:\n\"Never mind, Eeyore,\" said Christopher Robin, rubbing his hardest. \"Is\n_that_ better?\"\n\n\"It's feeling more like a tail perhaps. It Belongs again, if you know\nwhat I mean.\"\n\n\"Hullo, Eeyore,\" said Pooh, coming up to them with his pole.\n\n\"Hullo, Pooh. Thank you for asking, but I shall be able to use it again\nin a day or two.\"\n\n\"Use what?\" said Pooh.\n\n\"What we are talking about.\"\n\n\"I wasn't talking about anything,\" said Pooh, looking puzzled.\n\n\"My mistake again. I thought you were saying how sorry you were about my\ntail, being all numb, and could you do anything to help?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Pooh. \"That wasn't me,\" he said. He thought for a little and\nthen suggested helpfully, \"Perhaps it was somebody else.\"\n\n\"Well, thank him for me when you see him.\"\n\nPooh looked anxiously at Christopher Robin.\n\n\"Pooh's found the North Pole,\" said Christopher Robin. \"Isn't that\nlovely?\"\n\nPooh looked modestly down.\n\n\"Is that it?\" said Eeyore.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Christopher Robin.\n\n\"Is that what we were looking for?\"\n\"Hooray!\" you shouted.\n\n\"Isn't that fine?\" shouted Winnie-the-Pooh down to you. \"What do I look\nlike?\"\n\n\"You look like a Bear holding on to a balloon,\" you said.\n\n\"Not,\" said Pooh anxiously, \"--not like a small black cloud in a blue\nsky?\"\n\n\"Not very much.\"\n\n\"Ah, well, perhaps from up here it looks different. And, as I say, you\nnever can tell with bees.\"\n\nThere was no wind to blow him nearer to the tree, so there he stayed. He\ncould see the honey, he could smell the honey, but he couldn't quite\nreach the honey.\n\nAfter a little while he called down to you.\n\n\"Christopher Robin!\" he said in a loud whisper.\n\n\"Hallo!\"\n\n\"I think the bees _suspect_ something!\"\n\n\"What sort of thing?\"\n\n\"I don't know. But something tells me that they're _suspicious_!\"\n\n\"Perhaps they think that you're after their honey.\"\n\n\"It may be that. You never can tell with bees.\"\n\nThere was another little silence, and then he called down to you again.\n\n\"Christopher Robin!\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Have you an umbrella in your house?\"\n\"That's funny,\" he thought. \"I know I had a jar of honey there. A full\njar, full of honey right up to the top, and it had HUNNY written on it,\nso that I should know it was honey. That's very funny.\" And then he\nbegan to wander up and down, wondering where it was and murmuring a\nmurmur to himself. Like this:\n\n    It's very, very funny,\n    'Cos I _know_ I had some honey;\n    'Cos it had a label on,\n            Saying HUNNY.\n    A goloptious full-up pot too,\n    And I don't know where it's got to,\n    No, I don't know where it's gone--\n            Well, it's funny.\n\nHe had murmured this to himself three times in a singing sort of way,\nwhen suddenly he remembered. He had put it into the Cunning Trap to\ncatch the Heffalump.\n\n\"Bother!\" said Pooh. \"It all comes of trying to be kind to Heffalumps.\"\nAnd he got back into bed.\n\"Hallo!\"\n\n\"I think the bees _suspect_ something!\"\n\n\"What sort of thing?\"\n\n\"I don't know. But something tells me that they're _suspicious_!\"\n\n\"Perhaps they think that you're after their honey.\"\n\n\"It may be that.

I have discovered\nthat the bees are now definitely Suspicious.\"\n\"Bon-hommy,\" went on Eeyore gloomily. \"French word meaning bonhommy,\" he\nexplained. \"I'm not complaining, but There It Is.\"\n\nPooh sat down on a large stone, and tried to think this out. It sounded\nto him like a riddle, and he was never much good at riddles, being a\nBear of Very Little Brain. So he sang _Cottleston Pie_ instead:\n\n    Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie,\n    A fly can't bird, but a bird can fly.\n    Ask me a riddle and I reply:\n    \"_Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie._\"\n\nThat was the first verse. When he had finished it, Eeyore didn't\nactually say that he didn't like it, so Pooh very kindly sang the second\nverse to him:\n\n    Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie,\n    A fish can't whistle and neither can I.\n    Ask me a riddle and I reply:\n    \"_Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie_.\"\n\nEeyore still said nothing at all, so Pooh hummed the third verse quietly\nto himself:\n\nQuestion: What is a Woozle?\nAnswer:",

For it was in the\nHundred Acre Wood that Owl lived.\n\"And how are you?\" said Winnie-the-Pooh.\n\nEeyore shook his head from side to side.\n\n\"Not very how,\" he said. \"I don't seem to have felt at all how for a\nlong time.\"\n\n\"Dear, dear,\" said Pooh, \"I'm sorry about that. Let's have a look at\nyou.\"\n\nSo Eeyore stood there, gazing sadly at the ground, and Winnie-the-Pooh\nwalked all round him once.\n\n\"Why, what's happened to your tail?\" he said in surprise.\n\n\"What _has_ happened to it?\" said Eeyore.\n\n\"It isn't there!\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Well, either a tail _is_ there or it isn't there. You can't make a\nmistake about it. And yours _isn't_ there!\"\n\n\"Then what is?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Let's have a look,\" said Eeyore, and he turned slowly round to the\nplace where his tail had been a little while ago, and then, finding that\nhe couldn't catch it up, he turned round the other way, until he came\nback to where he was at first, and then he put his head down and looked\nbetween his front legs, and at last he said, with a long, sad sigh, \"I\nbelieve you're right.\"\n\"You're the Best Bear in All the World,\" said Christopher Robin\nsoothingly.\n\n\"Am I?\" said Pooh hopefully. And then he brightened up suddenly.\n\n\"Anyhow,\" he said, \"it is nearly Luncheon Time.\"\n\nSo he went home for it.\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER IV\n\n                      IN WHICH EEYORE LOSES A TAIL\n                           AND POOH FINDS ONE\n\n\nThe Old Grey Donkey, Eeyore, stood by himself in a thistly corner of\nthe forest, his front feet well apart, his head on one side, and thought\nabout things. Sometimes he thought sadly to himself, \"Why?\" and\nsometimes he thought, \"Wherefore?\" and sometimes he thought, \"Inasmuch\nas which?\"--and sometimes he didn't quite know what he _was_ thinking\nabout. So when Winnie-the-Pooh came stumping along, Eeyore was very glad\nto be able to stop thinking for a little, in order to say \"How do you\ndo?\" in a gloomy manner to him.\n\n\"And how are you?\" said Winnie-the-Pooh.\n\nEeyore shook his head from side to side.\n\"Many happy returns of the day,\" called out Pooh, forgetting that he had\nsaid it already.\n\n\"Thank you, Pooh, I'm having them,\" said Eeyore gloomily.\n\n\"I've brought you a little present,\" said Pooh excitedly.\n\n\"I've had it,\" said Eeyore.\n\nPooh had now splashed across the stream to Eeyore, and Piglet was\nsitting a little way off, his head in his paws, snuffling to himself.\n\n\"It's a Useful Pot,\" said Pooh. \"Here it is. And it's got 'A Very Happy\nBirthday with love from Pooh' written on it. That's what all that\nwriting is. And it's for putting things in. There!\"\n\nWhen Eeyore saw the pot, he became quite excited.\n\n\"Why!\" he said. \"I believe my Balloon will just go into that Pot!\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Eeyore,\" said Pooh. \"Balloons are much too big to go into Pots.\nWhat you do with a balloon is, you hold the ballon----\"\n\"Owl,\" said Pooh solemnly, \"you made a mistake. Somebody did want it.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Eeyore. My dear friend Eeyore. He was--he was fond of it.\"\n\n\"Fond of it?\"\n\n\"Attached to it,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh sadly.\n\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n\nSo with these words he unhooked it, and carried it back to Eeyore; and\nwhen Christopher Robin had nailed it on in its right place again, Eeyore\nfrisked about the forest, waving his tail so happily that\nWinnie-the-Pooh came over all funny, and had to hurry home for a little\nsnack of something to sustain him. And, wiping his mouth half an hour\nafterwards, he sang to himself proudly:\n\n    _Who found the Tail?_\n      \"I,\" said Pooh,\n    \"At a quarter to two\n      (Only it was quarter to eleven really),\n    _I_ found the Tail!\"\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER V\n\n                    IN WHICH PIGLET MEETS A HEFFALUMP\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Let's have a look,\" said Eeyore, and he turned slowly round to the\nplace where his tail had been a little while ago, and then, finding that\nhe couldn't catch it up, he turned round the other way, until he came\nback to where he was at first, and then he put his head down and looked\nbetween his front legs, and at last he said, with a long, sad sigh, \"I\nbelieve you're right.\"\n\n\"Of course I'm right,\" said Pooh.\n\n\"That Accounts for a Good Deal,\" said Eeyore gloomily. \"It Explains\nEverything. No Wonder.\"\n\n\"You must have left it somewhere,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh.\n\n\"Somebody must have taken it,\" said Eeyore. \"How Like Them,\" he added,\nafter a long silence.\n\nPooh felt that he ought to say something helpful about it, but didn't\nquite know what. So he decided to do something helpful instead.\n\n\"Eeyore,\" he said solemnly, \"I, Winnie-the-Pooh, will find your tail for\nyou.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Pooh,\" answered Eeyore. \"You're a real friend,\" said he.\n\"Not like Some,\" he said.\n\"I don't hold with all this washing,\" grumbled Eeyore. \"This modern\nBehind-the-ears nonsense. What do _you_ think, Pooh?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Pooh, \"_I_ think----\"\n\nBut we shall never know what Pooh thought, for there came a sudden\nsqueak from Roo, a splash, and a loud cry of alarm from Kanga.\n\n\"So much for _washing_,\" said Eeyore.\n\n\"Roo's fallen in!\" cried Rabbit, and he and Christopher Robin came\nrushing down to the rescue.\n\n\"Look at me swimming!\" squeaked Roo from the middle of his pool, and was\nhurried down a waterfall into the next pool.\n\n\"Are you all right, Roo dear?\" called Kanga anxiously.\n\n\"Yes!\" said Roo. \"Look at me sw----\" and down he went over the next\nwaterfall into another pool.\nBut Christopher Robin wasn't listening. He was looking at Pooh.\n\n\"Pooh,\" he said, \"where did you find that pole?\"\n\nPooh looked at the pole in his hands.\n\n\"I just found it,\" he said. \"I thought it ought to be useful. I just\npicked it up.\"\n\n\"Pooh,\" said Christopher Robin solemnly, \"the Expedition is over. You\nhave found the North Pole!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Pooh.\n\nEeyore was sitting with his tail in the water when they all got back to\nhim.\n\n\"Tell Roo to be quick, somebody,\" he said. \"My tail's getting cold. I\ndon't want to mention it, but I just mention it. I don't want to\ncomplain but there it is. My tail's cold.\"\n\n\"Here I am!\" squeaked Roo.\n\n\"Oh, there you are.\"\n\n\"Did you see me swimming?\"\n\nEeyore took his tail out of the water, and swished it from side to side.\n\n\"As I expected,\" he said. \"Lost all feeling. Numbed it. That's what it's\ndone. Numbed it. Well, as long as nobody minds, I suppose it's all\nright.\"\n\"Oh, help!\" said Pooh. \"I'd better go back.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother!\" said Pooh. \"I shall have to go on.\"\n\n\"I can't do either!\" said Pooh. \"Oh, help _and_ bother!\"\n\nNow by this time Rabbit wanted to go for a walk too, and finding the\nfront door full, he went out by the back door, and came round to Pooh,\nand looked at him.\n\n\"Hallo, are you stuck?\" he asked.\n\n\"N-no,\" said Pooh carelessly. \"Just resting and thinking and humming to\nmyself.\"\n\n\"Here, give us a paw.\"\n\nPooh Bear stretched out a paw, and Rabbit pulled and pulled and\npulled....\n\n\"_Ow!_\" cried Pooh. \"You're hurting!\"\n\n\"The fact is,\" said Rabbit, \"you're stuck.\"\n\n\"It all comes,\" said Pooh crossly, \"of not having front doors big\nenough.\"\n\n\"It all comes,\" said Rabbit sternly, \"of eating too much.

Do you think it's a--a--a Woozle?\"\n\"Six o'clock, Piglet. And have you got any string?\"\n\n\"No. Why do you want string?\"\n\n\"To lead them home with.\"\n\n\"Oh! ... I _think_ Heffalumps come if you whistle.\"\n\n\"Some do and some don't. You never can tell with Heffalumps. Well, good\nnight!\"\n\n\"Good night!\"\n\nAnd off Piglet trotted to his house TRESPASSERS W, while Pooh made his\npreparations for bed.\n\nSome hours later, just as the night was beginning to steal away, Pooh\nwoke up suddenly with a sinking feeling. He had had that sinking feeling\nbefore, and he knew what it meant. _He was hungry._ So he went to the\nlarder, and he stood on a chair and reached up to the top shelf, and\nfound--nothing.\n\n\"That's funny,\" he thought. \"I know I had a jar of honey there. A full\njar, full of honey right up to the top, and it had HUNNY written on it,\nso that I should know it was honey. That's very funny.\" And then he\nbegan to wander up and down, wondering where it was and murmuring a\nmurmur to himself. Like this:\n\"But then he would see us digging it,\" said Pooh.\n\n\"Not if he was looking at the sky.\"\n\n\"He would Suspect,\" said Pooh, \"if he happened to look down.\" He thought\nfor a long time and then added sadly, \"It isn't as easy as I thought. I\nsuppose that's why Heffalumps hardly _ever_ get caught.\"\n\n\"That must be it,\" said Piglet.\n\nThey sighed and got up; and when they had taken a few gorse prickles out\nof themselves they sat down again; and all the time Pooh was saying to\nhimself, \"If only I could _think_ of something!\" For he felt sure that a\nVery Clever Brain could catch a Heffalump if only he knew the right way\nto go about it.\n\n\"Suppose,\" he said to Piglet, \"_you_ wanted to catch _me_, how would you\ndo it?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Piglet, \"I should do it like this. I should make a Trap,\nand I should put a Jar of Honey in the Trap, and you would smell it, and\nyou would go in after it, and----\"\n\"Piglet,\" said Rabbit, taking out a pencil, and licking the end of it,\n\"you haven't any pluck.\"\n\n\"It is hard to be brave,\" said Piglet, sniffing slightly, \"when you're\nonly a Very Small Animal.\"\n\nRabbit, who had begun to write very busily, looked up and said:\n\n\"It is because you are a very small animal that you will be Useful in\nthe adventure before us.\"\n\nPiglet was so excited at the idea of being Useful, that he forgot to be\nfrightened any more, and when Rabbit went on to say that Kangas were\nonly Fierce during the winter months, being at other times of an\nAffectionate Disposition, he could hardly sit still, he was so eager to\nbegin being useful at once.\n\n\"What about me?\" said Pooh sadly. \"I suppose _I_ shan't be useful?\"\n\n\"Never mind, Pooh,\" said Piglet comfortingly. \"Another time perhaps.\"\n\n\"Without Pooh,\" said Rabbit solemnly as he sharpened his pencil, \"the\nadventure would be impossible.\"\nFor it was rather exciting. The little dry ditches in which Piglet had\nnosed about so often had become streams, the little streams across which\nhe had splashed were rivers, and the river, between whose steep banks\nthey had played so happily, had sprawled out of its own bed and was\ntaking up so much room everywhere, that Piglet was beginning to wonder\nwhether it would be coming into _his_ bed soon.\n\n\"It's a little Anxious,\" he said to himself, \"to be a Very Small Animal\nEntirely Surrounded by Water. Christopher Robin and Pooh could escape by\nClimbing Trees, and Kanga could escape by Jumping, and Rabbit could\nescape by Burrowing, and Owl could escape by Flying, and Eeyore could\nescape by--by Making a Loud Noise Until Rescued, and here am I,\nsurrounded by water and I can't do _anything_.\"\n\nIt went on raining, and every day the water got a little higher, until\nnow it was nearly up to Piglet's window ... and still he hadn't done\nanything.\n\nQuestion: What did Piglet and Pooh use to try to catch a Heffalump?\nAnswer:",

And then seeing that Owl expected him to say something\nelse, he said \"Will there be those little cake things with pink sugar\nicing?\"\n\nOwl felt that it was rather beneath him to talk about little cake things\nwith pink sugar icing, so he told Pooh exactly what Christopher Robin\nhad said, and flew off to Eeyore.\n\n\"A party for Me?\" thought Pooh to himself. \"How grand!\" And he began to\nwonder if all the other animals would know that it was a special Pooh\nParty, and if Christopher Robin had told them about _The Floating Bear_\nand the _Brain of Pooh_ and all the wonderful ships he had invented and\nsailed on, and he began to think how awful it would be if everybody had\nforgotten about it, and nobody quite knew what the party was for; and\nthe more he thought like this, the more the party got muddled in his\nmind, like a dream when nothing goes right. And the dream began to sing\nitself over in his head until it became a sort of song. It was an\nHIPY PAPY BTHUTHDTH THUTHDA BTHUTHDY.\n\nPooh looked on admiringly.\n\n\"I'm just saying 'A Happy Birthday',\" said Owl carelessly.\n\n\"It's a nice long one,\" said Pooh, very much impressed by it.\n\n\"Well, _actually_, of course, I'm saying 'A Very Happy Birthday with\nlove from Pooh.' Naturally it takes a good deal of pencil to say a long\nthing like that.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see,\" said Pooh.\n\nWhile all this was happening, Piglet had gone back to his own house to\nget Eeyore's balloon. He held it very tightly against himself, so that\nit shouldn't blow away, and he ran as fast as he could so as to get to\nEeyore before Pooh did; for he thought that he would like to be the\nfirst one to give a present, just as if he had thought of it without\nbeing told by anybody. And running along, and thinking how pleased\nEeyore would be, he didn't look where he was going ... and suddenly he\nput his foot in a rabbit hole, and fell down flat on his face.\n\nBANG!!!???***!!!\n\"But Pooh,\" said Piglet, \"it's your own house!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Pooh. \"So it is,\" he said. \"Well, let's go in.\"\n\nSo in they went. The first thing Pooh did was to go to the cupboard to\nsee if he had quite a small jar of honey left; and he had, so he took it\ndown.\n\n\"I'm giving this to Eeyore,\" he explained, \"as a present. What are _you_\ngoing to give?\"\n\n\"Couldn't I give it too?\" said Piglet. \"From both of us?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Pooh. \"That would _not_ be a good plan.\"\n\n\"All right, then, I'll give him a balloon. I've got one left from my\nparty. I'll go and get it now, shall I?\"\n\n\"That, Piglet, is a _very_ good idea. It is just what Eeyore wants to\ncheer him up. Nobody can be uncheered with a balloon.\"\n\nSo off Piglet trotted; and in the other direction went Pooh, with his\njar of honey.\n\"Now let me see,\" he thought, as he took his last lick of the inside of\nthe jar, \"where was I going? Ah, yes, Eeyore.\" He got up slowly.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, he remembered. He had eaten Eeyore's birthday\npresent!\n\n\"_Bother!_\" said Pooh. \"What _shall_ I do? I _must_ give him\n_something_.\"\n\nFor a little while he couldn't think of anything. Then he thought:\n\"Well, it's a very nice pot, even if there's no honey in it, and if I\nwashed it clean, and got somebody to write '_A Happy Birthday_' on it,\nEeyore could keep things in it, which might be Useful.\" So, as he was\njust passing the Hundred Acre Wood, he went inside to call on Owl, who\nlived there.\n\n\"Good morning, Owl,\" he said.\n\n\"Good morning, Pooh,\" said Owl.\n\n\"Many happy returns of Eeyore's birthday,\" said Pooh.\n\n\"Oh, is that what it is?\"\n\n\"What are you giving him, Owl?\"\n\n\"What are _you_ giving him, Pooh?\"\n\n\"I'm giving him a Useful Pot to Keep Things In, and I wanted to ask\nyou----\"\n\n\"Is this it?\" said Owl, taking it out of Pooh's paw.\n\"Oh!\" said Pooh.\n\n\"Oh, Pooh!\" said everybody else except Eeyore.\n\n\"Thank-you,\" growled Pooh.\n\nBut Eeyore was saying to himself, \"This writing business. Pencils and\nwhat-not. Over-rated, if you ask me. Silly stuff. Nothing in it.\"\n\nLater on, when they had all said \"Good-bye\" and \"Thank-you\" to\nChristopher Robin, Pooh and Piglet walked home thoughtfully together in\nthe golden evening, and for a long time they were silent.\n\n\"When you wake up in the morning, Pooh,\" said Piglet at last, \"what's\nthe first thing you say to yourself?\"\n\n\"What's for breakfast?\" said Pooh. \"What do _you_ say, Piglet?\"\n\n\"I say, I wonder what's going to happen exciting _to-day_?\" said Piglet.\n\nPooh nodded thoughtfully.\n\n\"It's the same thing,\" he said.\n\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n\n\"And what did happen?\" asked Christopher Robin.\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"Next morning.\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Could you think and tell me and Pooh some time?\"\n\n\"If you wanted it very much.\"\nPooh scratched his head, being a little puzzled by all this.\n\n\"But is it really your birthday?\" he asked.\n\n\"It is.\"\n\n\"Oh! Well, Many happy returns of the day, Eeyore.\"\n\n\"And many happy returns to you, Pooh Bear.\"\n\n\"But it isn't _my_ birthday.\"\n\n\"No, it's mine.\"\n\n\"But you said 'Many happy returns'----\"\n\n\"Well, why not? You don't always want to be miserable on my birthday, do\nyou?\"\n\n\"Oh, I see,\" said Pooh.\n\n\"It's bad enough,\" said Eeyore, almost breaking down, \"being miserable\nmyself, what with no presents and no cake and no candles, and no proper\nnotice taken of me at all, but if everybody else is going to be\nmiserable too----\"\n\nThis was too much for Pooh. \"Stay there!\" he called to Eeyore, as he\nturned and hurried back home as quick as he could; for he felt that he\nmust get poor Eeyore a present of _some_ sort at once, and he could\nalways think of a proper one afterwards.\n\nOutside his house he found Piglet, jumping up and down trying to reach\nthe knocker.\n\n\"Hallo, Piglet,\" he said.\n\"Eeyore,\" he said solemnly, \"I, Winnie-the-Pooh, will find your tail for\nyou.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Pooh,\" answered Eeyore. \"You're a real friend,\" said he.\n\"Not like Some,\" he said.\n\nSo Winnie-the-Pooh went off to find Eeyore's tail.\n\nIt was a fine spring morning in the forest as he started out. Little\nsoft clouds played happily in a blue sky, skipping from time to time in\nfront of the sun as if they had come to put it out, and then sliding\naway suddenly so that the next might have his turn. Through them and\nbetween them the sun shone bravely; and a copse which had worn its firs\nall the year round seemed old and dowdy now beside the new green lace\nwhich the beeches had put on so prettily. Through copse and spinney\nmarched Bear; down open slopes of gorse and heather, over rocky beds of\nstreams, up steep banks of sandstone into the heather again; and so at\nlast, tired and hungry, to the Hundred Acre Wood.

So I suppose\nI really ought to go back and do it now.\"\n\n\"We'll do it this afternoon, and I'll come with you,\" said Pooh.\n\n\"It isn't the sort of thing you can do in the afternoon,\" said Piglet\nquickly. \"It's a very particular morning thing, that has to be done in\nthe morning, and, if possible, between the hours of----What would you\nsay the time was?\"\n\"It's--I wondered--It's only--Rabbit, I suppose _you_ don't know, What\ndoes the North Pole _look_ like?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Rabbit, stroking his whiskers. \"Now you're asking me.\"\n\n\"I did know once, only I've sort of forgotten,\" said Christopher Robin\ncarelessly.\n\n\"It's a funny thing,\" said Rabbit, \"but I've sort of forgotten too,\nalthough I did know _once_.\"\n\n\"I suppose it's just a pole stuck in the ground?\"\n\n\"Sure to be a pole,\" said Rabbit, \"because of calling it a pole, and if\nit's a pole, well, I should think it would be sticking in the ground,\nshouldn't you, because there'd be nowhere else to stick it.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's what I thought.\"\n\n\"The only thing,\" said Rabbit, \"is, _where is it sticking_?\"\n\n\"That's what we're looking for,\" said Christopher Robin.\n\"It may be,\" said Pooh. \"Sometimes it is, and sometimes it isn't. You\nnever can tell with paw-marks.\"\n\nWith these few words he went on tracking, and Piglet, after watching him\nfor a minute or two, ran after him. Winnie-the-Pooh had come to a sudden\nstop, and was bending over the tracks in a puzzled sort of way.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Piglet.\n\n\"It's a very funny thing,\" said Bear, \"but there seem to be\n_two_ animals now. This--whatever-it-was--has been joined by\nanother--whatever-it-is--and the two of them are now proceeding\nin company. Would you mind coming with me, Piglet, in case they\nturn out to be Hostile Animals?\"\n\nPiglet scratched his ear in a nice sort of way, and said that he had\nnothing to do until Friday, and would be delighted to come, in case it\nreally _was_ a Woozle.\n\n\"You mean, in case it really is two Woozles,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh, and\nPiglet said that anyhow he had nothing to do until Friday. So off they\nwent together.\nAnd then at last Kanga did turn her head to look. And the moment that\nher head was turned, Rabbit said in a loud voice \"In you go, Roo!\" and\nin jumped Piglet into Kanga's pocket, and off scampered Rabbit, with Roo\nin his paws, as fast as he could.\n\n\"Why, where's Rabbit?\" said Kanga, turning round again. \"Are you all\nright, Roo, dear?\"\n\nPiglet made a squeaky Roo-noise from the bottom of Kanga's pocket.\n\n\"Rabbit had to go away,\" said Pooh. \"I think he thought of something he\nhad to go and see about suddenly.\"\n\n\"And Piglet?\"\n\n\"I think Piglet thought of something at the same time. Suddenly.\"\n\n\"Well, we must be getting home,\" said Kanga. \"Good-bye, Pooh.\" And in\nthree large jumps she was gone.\n\nPooh looked after her as she went.\n\n\"I wish I could jump like that,\" he thought. \"Some can and some can't.\nThat's how it is.\"\n\"I gave him a box of paints to paint things with.\"\n\n\"That was it.\"\n\n\"Why didn't I give it to him in the morning?\"\n\n\"You were so busy getting his party ready for him.

When Pooh asked Christopher Robin, \"How did\nthey come here?\" Christopher Robin said, \"In the Usual Way, if you know\nwhat I mean, Pooh,\" and Pooh, who didn't, said \"Oh!\" Then he nodded his\nhead twice and said, \"In the Usual Way. Ah!\" Then he went to call upon\nhis friend Piglet to see what _he_ thought about it. And at Piglet's\nhouse he found Rabbit. So they all talked about it together.\n\"Hallo, Pooh,\" he said. \"How's things?\"\n\n\"Terrible and Sad,\" said Pooh, \"because Eeyore, who is a friend of mine,\nhas lost his tail.

So could you very kindly\ntell me how to find it for him?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Owl, \"the customary procedure in such cases is as follows.\"\n\n\"What does Crustimoney Proseedcake mean?\" said Pooh. \"For I am a Bear of\nVery Little Brain, and long words Bother me.\"\n\n\"It means the Thing to Do.\"\n\n\"As long as it means that, I don't mind,\" said Pooh humbly.\n\n\"The thing to do is as follows.

I'll go and\ntell them.\" And he stumped off.\n\nThe first person he met was Rabbit.\n\n\"Hallo, Rabbit,\" he said, \"is that you?\"\n\n\"Let's pretend it isn't,\" said Rabbit, \"and see what happens.\"\n\n\"I've got a message for you.\"\n\n\"I'll give it to him.\"\n\"It's--I wondered--It's only--Rabbit, I suppose _you_ don't know, What\ndoes the North Pole _look_ like?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Rabbit, stroking his whiskers. \"Now you're asking me.\"\n\n\"I did know once, only I've sort of forgotten,\" said Christopher Robin\ncarelessly.\n\n\"It's a funny thing,\" said Rabbit, \"but I've sort of forgotten too,\nalthough I did know _once_.\"\n\n\"I suppose it's just a pole stuck in the ground?\"\n\n\"Sure to be a pole,\" said Rabbit, \"because of calling it a pole, and if\nit's a pole, well, I should think it would be sticking in the ground,\nshouldn't you, because there'd be nowhere else to stick it.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's what I thought.\"\n\n\"The only thing,\" said Rabbit, \"is, _where is it sticking_?\"\n\n\"That's what we're looking for,\" said Christopher Robin.\nBut Christopher Robin wasn't listening. He was looking at Pooh.\n\n\"Pooh,\" he said, \"where did you find that pole?\"\n\nPooh looked at the pole in his hands.\n\n\"I just found it,\" he said. \"I thought it ought to be useful. I just\npicked it up.\"\n\n\"Pooh,\" said Christopher Robin solemnly, \"the Expedition is over. You\nhave found the North Pole!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Pooh.\n\nEeyore was sitting with his tail in the water when they all got back to\nhim.\n\n\"Tell Roo to be quick, somebody,\" he said. \"My tail's getting cold. I\ndon't want to mention it, but I just mention it. I don't want to\ncomplain but there it is. My tail's cold.\"\n\n\"Here I am!\" squeaked Roo.\n\n\"Oh, there you are.\"\n\n\"Did you see me swimming?\"\n\nEeyore took his tail out of the water, and swished it from side to side.\n\n\"As I expected,\" he said. \"Lost all feeling. Numbed it. That's what it's\ndone. Numbed it. Well, as long as nobody minds, I suppose it's all\nright.\"\n\"There's a South Pole,\" said Christopher Robin, \"and I expect there's an\nEast Pole and a West Pole, though people don't like talking about them.\"\n\nPooh was very excited when he heard this, and suggested that they should\nhave an Expotition to discover the East Pole, but Christopher Robin had\nthought of something else to do with Kanga; so Pooh went out to discover\nthe East Pole by himself. Whether he discovered it or not, I forget; but\nhe was so tired when he got home that, in the very middle of his supper,\nafter he had been eating for little more than half-an-hour, he fell fast\nasleep in his chair, and slept and slept and slept.\nThen suddenly he was dreaming. He was at the East Pole, and it was a\nvery cold pole with the coldest sort of snow and ice all over it. He had\nfound a bee-hive to sleep in, but there wasn't room for his legs, so he\nhad left them outside. And Wild Woozles, such as inhabit the East Pole,\ncame and nibbled all the fur off his legs to make nests for their Young.\nAnd the more they nibbled, the colder his legs got, until suddenly he\nwoke up with an _Ow!_--and there he was, sitting in his chair with his\nfeet in the water, and water all round him!\n\nHe splashed to his door and looked out....\n\n\"This is Serious,\" said Pooh. \"I must have an Escape.\"\n\nSo he took his largest pot of honey and escaped with it to a broad\nbranch of his tree, well above the water, and then he climbed down again\nand escaped with another pot ... and when the whole Escape was\nfinished, there was Pooh sitting on his branch, dangling his legs, and\nthere, beside him, were ten pots of honey....\n\"Do you see, Piglet? Look at their tracks! Three, as it were, Woozles,\nand one, as it was, Wizzle. _Another Woozle has joined them!_\"\n\nAnd so it seemed to be. There were the tracks; crossing over each other\nhere, getting muddled up with each other there; but, quite plainly every\nnow and then, the tracks of four sets of paws.\n\n\"I _think_,\" said Piglet, when he had licked the tip of his nose too,\nand found that it brought very little comfort, \"I _think_ that I have\njust remembered something. I have just remembered something that I\nforgot to do yesterday and shan't be able to do to-morrow. So I suppose\nI really ought to go back and do it now.\"\n\n\"We'll do it this afternoon, and I'll come with you,\" said Pooh.\n\n\"It isn't the sort of thing you can do in the afternoon,\" said Piglet\nquickly. \"It's a very particular morning thing, that has to be done in\nthe morning, and, if possible, between the hours of----What would you\nsay the time was?\"\n\"I see what Eeyore means,\" said Owl. \"If you ask me----\"\n\n\"I'm not asking anybody,\" said Eeyore. \"I'm just telling everybody. We\ncan look for the North Pole, or we can play 'Here we go gathering Nuts\nand May' with the end part of an ant's nest. It's all the same to me.\"\n\nThere was a shout from the top of the line.\n\n\"Come on!\" called Christopher Robin.\n\n\"Come on!\" called Pooh and Piglet.\n\n\"Come on!\" called Owl.\n\n\"We're starting,\" said Rabbit. \"I must go.\" And he hurried off to the\nfront of the Expotition with Christopher Robin.\n\n\"All right,\" said Eeyore. \"We're going. Only Don't Blame Me.\"\n\nSo off they all went to discover the Pole. And as they walked, they\nchattered to each other of this and that, all except Pooh, who was\nmaking up a song.\n\n\"This is the first verse,\" he said to Piglet, when he was ready with it.\n\n\"First verse of what?\"\n\n\"My song.\"\n\n\"What song?\"\n\n\"This one.\"\n\n\"Which one?\"\n\n\"Well, if you listen, Piglet, you'll hear it.\"\n\n\"How do you know I'm not listening?\"\n\"Well, thank him for me when you see him.\"\n\nPooh looked anxiously at Christopher Robin.\n\n\"Pooh's found the North Pole,\" said Christopher Robin. \"Isn't that\nlovely?\"\n\nPooh looked modestly down.\n\n\"Is that it?\" said Eeyore.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Christopher Robin.\n\n\"Is that what we were looking for?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pooh.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Eeyore. \"Well, anyhow--it didn't rain,\" he said.\n\nThey stuck the pole in the ground, and Christopher Robin tied a message\non to it.\n\n                               NORTH POLE\n\n                           DISCOVERED BY POOH\n\n                             POOH FOUND IT.\n\nThen they all went home again. And I think, but I am not quite sure,\nthat Roo had a hot bath and went straight to bed. But Pooh went back to\nhis own house, and feeling very proud of what he had done, had a little\nsomething to revive himself.\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER IX\n\n                       IN WHICH PIGLET IS ENTIRELY\n                           SURROUNDED BY WATER\nYou can't be in London for long without going to the Zoo.

So when Christopher Robin goes to the Zoo, he goes\nto where the Polar Bears are, and he whispers something to the third\nkeeper from the left, and doors are unlocked, and we wander through dark\npassages and up steep stairs, until at last we come to the special cage,\nand the cage is opened, and out trots something brown and furry, and\nwith a happy cry of \"Oh, Bear!\" Christopher Robin rushes into its arms.\nNow this bear's name is Winnie, which shows what a good name for bears\nit is, but the funny thing is that we can't remember whether Winnie is\ncalled after Pooh, or Pooh after Winnie. We did know once, but we have\nforgotten....\n(_\"What does 'under the name' mean?\" asked Christopher Robin._\n\n\"_It means he had the name over the door in gold letters, and lived\nunder it._\"\n\n_\"Winnie-the-Pooh wasn't quite sure,\" said Christopher Robin._\n\n_\"Now I am,\" said a growly voice._\n\n_\"Then I will go on,\" said I._)\n\nOne day when he was out walking, he came to an open place in the middle\nof the forest, and in the middle of this place was a large oak-tree,\nand, from the top of the tree, there came a loud buzzing-noise.\n\nWinnie-the-Pooh sat down at the foot of the tree, put his head between\nhis paws and began to think.\n\nFirst of all he said to himself: \"That buzzing-noise means something.\nYou don't get a buzzing-noise like that, just buzzing and buzzing,\nwithout its meaning something.

Next to his house was a piece of broken\nboard which had: \"TRESPASSERS W\" on it. When Christopher Robin asked the\nPiglet what it meant, he said it was his grandfather's name, and had\nbeen in the family for a long time, Christopher Robin said you\n_couldn't_ be called Trespassers W, and Piglet said yes, you could,\nbecause his grandfather was, and it was short for Trespassers Will,\nwhich was short for Trespassers William. And his grandfather had had two\nnames in case he lost one--Trespassers after an uncle, and William after\nTrespassers.\n\n\"I've got two names,\" said Christopher Robin carelessly.\n\n\"Well, there you are, that proves it,\" said Piglet.\nThis was too much for Pooh. \"Stay there!\" he called to Eeyore, as he\nturned and hurried back home as quick as he could; for he felt that he\nmust get poor Eeyore a present of _some_ sort at once, and he could\nalways think of a proper one afterwards.\n\nOutside his house he found Piglet, jumping up and down trying to reach\nthe knocker.\n\n\"Hallo, Piglet,\" he said.\n\n\"Hallo, Pooh,\" said Piglet.\n\n\"What are _you_ trying to do?\"\n\n\"I was trying to reach the knocker,\" said Piglet. \"I just came\nround----\"\n\n\"Let me do it for you,\" said Pooh kindly.

Piglet was lying on his back, sleeping\npeacefully.

Did you see them,\nPooh?\"\n\nFor some time now Pooh had been saying \"Yes\" and \"No\" in turn, with his\neyes shut, to all that Owl was saying, and having said, \"Yes, yes,\" last\ntime, he said \"No, not at all,\" now, without really knowing what Owl was\ntalking about.\n\n\"Didn't you see them?\" said Owl, a little surprised. \"Come and look at\nthem now.\"\nIX.

But something tells me that they're _suspicious_!\"\n\n\"Perhaps they think that you're after their honey.\"\n\n\"It may be that. You never can tell with bees.\"\n\nThere was another little silence, and then he called down to you again.\n\n\"Christopher Robin!\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Have you an umbrella in your house?\"\n\n\"I think so.\"\n\n\"I wish you would bring it out here, and walk up and down with it, and\nlook up at me every now and then, and say 'Tut-tut, it looks like rain.'\nI think, if you did that, it would help the deception which we are\npractising on these bees.\"\n\nWell, you laughed to yourself, \"Silly old Bear!\" but you didn't say it\naloud because you were so fond of him, and you went home for your\numbrella.\n\n\"Oh, there you are!\" called down Winnie-the-Pooh, as soon as you got\nback to the tree. \"I was beginning to get anxious. I have discovered\nthat the bees are now definitely Suspicious.\"\nHe left the window and began to search his house, all of it that wasn't\nunder water, and at last he found a pencil and a small piece of dry\npaper, and a bottle with a cork to it. And he wrote on one side of the\npaper:\n\n                                 HELP!\n                              PIGLET (ME)\n\nand on the other side:\n\n                       IT'S ME PIGLET, HELP HELP.\n\nThen he put the paper in the bottle, and he corked the bottle up as\ntightly as he could, and he leant out of his window as far as he could\nlean without falling in, and he threw the bottle as far as he could\nthrow--_splash!_--and in a little while it bobbed up again on the water;\nand he watched it floating slowly away in the distance, until his eyes\nached with looking, and sometimes he thought it was the bottle, and\nsometimes he thought it was just a ripple on the water which he was\nfollowing, and then suddenly he knew that he would never see it again\nand that he had done all that he could do to save himself.\n\"Not there?\"\n\n\"Has _been_ there. He's been sitting on a branch of his tree outside his\nhouse with nine pots of honey.

On my boat.\"\n\nWith these proud words he gave Christopher Robin the missage.\n\n\"But it's from Piglet!\" cried Christopher Robin when he had read it.\n\n\"Isn't there anything about Pooh in it?\" asked Bear, looking over his\nshoulder.\n\nChristopher Robin read the message aloud.\n\n\"Oh, are those 'P's' piglets? I thought they were poohs.\"\n\n\"We must rescue him at once! I thought he was with _you_, Pooh. Owl,\ncould you rescue him on your back?\"\n\"Help, help!\" cried Piglet, \"a Heffalump, a Horrible Heffalump!\" and he\nscampered off as hard as he could, still crying out, \"Help, help, a\nHerrible Hoffalump! Hoff, Hoff, a Hellible Horralump! Holl, Holl, a\nHoffable Hellerump!\" And he didn't stop crying and scampering until he\ngot to Christopher Robin's house.\n\n\"Whatever's the matter, Piglet?\" said Christopher Robin, who was just\ngetting up.\n\n\"Heff,\" said Piglet, breathing so hard that he could hardly speak, \"a\nHeff--a Heff--a Heffalump.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Up there,\" said Piglet, waving his paw.\n\n\"What did it look like?\"\n\n\"Like--like----It had the biggest head you ever saw, Christopher Robin.\nA great enormous thing, like--like nothing. A huge big--well, like a--I\ndon't know--like an enormous big nothing. Like a jar.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Christopher Robin, putting on his shoes, \"I shall go and\nlook at it. Come on.\"\n\nPiglet wasn't afraid if he had Christopher Robin with him, so off they\nwent....\nUnderneath the bell-pull there was a notice which said:\n\n                  PLEZ CNOKE IF AN RNSR IS NOT REQID.\n\nThese notices had been written by Christopher Robin, who was the only\none in the forest who could spell; for Owl, wise though he was in many\nways, able to read and write and spell his own name WOL, yet somehow\nwent all to pieces over delicate words like MEASLES and BUTTEREDTOAST.\n\nWinnie-the-Pooh read the two notices very carefully, first from left to\nright, and afterwards, in case he had missed some of it, from right to\nleft. Then, to make quite sure, he knocked and pulled the knocker, and\nhe pulled and knocked the bell-rope, and he called out in a very loud\nvoice, \"Owl! I require an answer! It's Bear speaking.\" And the door\nopened, and Owl looked out.\n\n\"Hallo, Pooh,\" he said. \"How's things?\"\n\n\"Terrible and Sad,\" said Pooh, \"because Eeyore, who is a friend of mine,\nhas lost his tail.

Baby Roo was practising very small jumps in the sand, and\nfalling down mouse-holes and climbing out of them, and Kanga was\nfidgeting about and saying \"Just one more jump, dear, and then we must\ngo home.\" And at that moment who should come stumping up the hill but\nPooh.\n\n\"Good afternoon, Kanga.\"\n\n\"Good afternoon, Pooh.\"\n\n\"Look at me jumping,\" squeaked Roo, and fell into another mouse-hole.\n\n\"Hallo, Roo, my little fellow!\"\n\n\"We were just going home,\" said Kanga. \"Good afternoon, Rabbit. Good\nafternoon, Piglet.\"\nAnd then at last Kanga did turn her head to look. And the moment that\nher head was turned, Rabbit said in a loud voice \"In you go, Roo!\" and\nin jumped Piglet into Kanga's pocket, and off scampered Rabbit, with Roo\nin his paws, as fast as he could.\n\n\"Why, where's Rabbit?\" said Kanga, turning round again. \"Are you all\nright, Roo, dear?\"\n\nPiglet made a squeaky Roo-noise from the bottom of Kanga's pocket.\n\n\"Rabbit had to go away,\" said Pooh. \"I think he thought of something he\nhad to go and see about suddenly.\"\n\n\"And Piglet?\"\n\n\"I think Piglet thought of something at the same time. Suddenly.\"\n\n\"Well, we must be getting home,\" said Kanga. \"Good-bye, Pooh.\" And in\nthree large jumps she was gone.\n\nPooh looked after her as she went.\n\n\"I wish I could jump like that,\" he thought. \"Some can and some can't.\nThat's how it is.\"\nthis                              take\n    \"If      is          shall      really    to\n                flying I      never              it.\"\n\nAnd as he went up in the air he said, \"_Ooooooo!_\" and as he came down\nhe said, \"_Ow!_\" And he was saying, \"_Ooooooo-ow, Ooooooo-ow,\nOoooooo-ow_\" all the way to Kanga's house.\n\nOf course as soon as Kanga unbuttoned her pocket, she saw what had\nhappened. Just for a moment, she thought she was frightened, and then\nshe knew she wasn't; for she felt quite sure that Christopher Robin\nwould never let any harm happen to Roo. So she said to herself, \"If they\nare having a joke with me, I will have a joke with them.\"\n\n\"Now then, Roo, dear,\" she said, as she took Piglet out of her pocket.\n\"Bed-time.\"\n\n\"_Aha!_\" said Piglet, as well as he could after his Terrifying Journey.\nBut it wasn't a very good \"_Aha!_\" and Kanga didn't seem to understand\nwhat it meant.\n\n\"Bath first,\" said Kanga in a cheerful voice.\n\"The question is, What are we to do about Kanga?\"\n\n\"Oh, I see,\" said Pooh.\n\n\"The best way,\" said Rabbit, \"would be this. The best way would be to\nsteal Baby Roo and hide him, and then when Kanga says, 'Where's Baby\nRoo?' we say, '_Aha!_'\"\n\n\"_Aha!_\" said Pooh, practising. \"_Aha! Aha!_ ... Of course,\" he went\non, \"we could say 'Aha!' even if we hadn't stolen Baby Roo.\"\n\n\"Pooh,\" said Rabbit kindly, \"you haven't any brain.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Pooh humbly.\n\n\"We say '_Aha!_' so that Kanga knows that _we_ know where Baby Roo is.\n'_Aha!_' means 'We'll tell you where Baby Roo is, if you promise to go\naway from the Forest and never come back.' Now don't talk while I\nthink.\"\n\nPooh went into a corner and tried saying 'Aha!' in that sort of voice.\nSometimes it seemed to him that it did mean what Rabbit said, and\nsometimes it seemed to him that it didn't. \"I suppose it's just\npractice,\" he thought. \"I wonder if Kanga will have to practise too so\nas to understand it.\"\n\"I knew it wasn't Piglet,\" said Kanga. \"I wonder who it can be.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it's some relation of Pooh's,\" said Christopher Robin. \"What\nabout a nephew or an uncle or something?\"\n\nKanga agreed that this was probably what it was, and said that they\nwould have to call it by some name.\n\n\"I shall call it Pootel,\" said Christopher Robin. \"Henry Pootel for\nshort.\"\n\nAnd just when it was decided, Henry Pootel wriggled out of Kanga's arms\nand jumped to the ground. To his great joy Christopher Robin had left\nthe door open. Never had Henry Pootel Piglet run so fast as he ran then,\nand he didn't stop running until he had got quite close to his house.\nBut when he was a hundred yards away he stopped running, and rolled the\nrest of the way home, so as to get his own nice comfortable colour\nagain....\nBefore he knew where he was, Piglet was in the bath, and Kanga was\nscrubbing him firmly with a large lathery flannel.\n\n\"Ow!\" cried Piglet. \"Let me out! I'm Piglet!\"\n\n\"Don't open the mouth, dear, or the soap goes in,\" said Kanga. \"There!\nWhat did I tell you?\"\n\n\"You--you--you did it on purpose,\" spluttered Piglet, as soon as he\ncould speak again ... and then accidentally had another mouthful of\nlathery flannel.\n\n\"That's right, dear, don't say anything,\" said Kanga, and in another\nminute Piglet was out of the bath, and being rubbed dry with a towel.\n\n\"Now,\" said Kanga, \"there's your medicine, and then bed.\"\n\n\"W-w-what medicine?\" said Piglet.\n\n\"To make you grow big and strong, dear. You don't want to grow up small\nand weak like Piglet, do you? Well, then!\"\n\nAt that moment there was a knock at the door.\n\n\"Come in,\" said Kanga, and in came Christopher Robin.\n\n\"Christopher Robin, Christopher Robin!\" cried Piglet. \"Tell Kanga who I\nam! She keeps saying I'm Roo. I'm _not_ Roo, am I?\"\n5. Like Roo.\n\n   6. But Kanga would have to be looking the other way first, so as not\n      to see Piglet jumping in.\n\n   7.
